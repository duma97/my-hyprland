## ⚙️ Installation Guide

This guide assumes you are on Arch Linux.For other Distros look for my other Repos.

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, ensure your system is up-to-date and install the necessary packages from the official repositories.

```bash
sudo pacman -S git wofi rofi firefox hyprpaper hyprlock hyprshot waybar vim code fastfetch hyfetch
```
 That's the base we need, you can install additional packages by your own.
